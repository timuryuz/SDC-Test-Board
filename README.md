# SDC-Test-Board
Led team of 6 to create a test PCB for Terps Racing EV's shut down circuit (SDC), which controlls
important safety features on the electric vehicle like brakes, propulsion, and
battery management. The SDC was designed to send flicker faults 1-20ms to 
simulate transient signal loss. Personally created all schematics, 2D layout
(wire traces), and 3D layout. Selected componenets and assembled board by
hand soldering components, both thru-hole and surface mount. Tested 
validity of the PCB using DMMs, oscilloscope, and power supply.
